   interpolating `:font-weight`/`:font-style` (cssom.layout now threads
   both through onto every :text op) ahead of the font-size/family that
   were always here -- before this, a real, cascade-computed CSS
   `font-weight: bold`/`font-style: italic` had ZERO visual effect,
   confirmed via direct REPL reproduction that the resolved :style/
   font-weight/:style/font-style attrs existed but layout's own :text
   draw-op never carried them at all. Absent or literally `\"normal\"`
   (real CSS's own initial value for both properties) contributes
   nothing to the string, matching this op's exact pre-existing
   behavior byte-for-byte when neither property was ever set. A numeric
   font-weight (`\"700\"`) is passed through verbatim rather than
   restricted to the `bold`/`normal` keywords -- Canvas 2D's own `font`
   property accepts a numeric weight directly, same as real CSS.

   `:font-family`, likewise now threaded through by cssom.layout, is
   interpolated ahead of the SAME fixed `ui-sans-serif, system-ui,
   sans-serif` fallback this always used -- a real author `font-family`
   had ZERO visual effect no matter what a real page declared, every
   :text draw-op hardcoding this same fallback regardless of the real,
   cascade-computed `:style/font-family` attr, the exact same bug shape
   already fixed for font-weight/font-style above. Passed through
   VERBATIM (not validated against a known-font allowlist) -- a real
   browser's own Canvas 2D `font` string accepts any author-supplied
   family list unchanged too, falling back to a generic family (this
   engine's own fixed fallback) only when the whole list fails to
   resolve to an installed font, exactly matching real CSS font-stack
   fallback behavior.

   Also reused by measure-text-fn below (given an equivalent map shape)
   so word-wrap MEASUREMENT and real PAINT always agree on which exact
   font string a run of text uses."

(defn- measure-text-fn
  "Builds a (fn [text font-size font-weight font-style font-family]
   width-in-px) backed by `ctx`'s real
   `CanvasRenderingContext2D.measureText` -- passed down into
   cssom.layout/draw-ops (via retained/draw-ops's own optional
   measure-text arg) so word-wrap decisions agree with the real,
   proportional system font `render!` actually paints text with
   below, instead of cssom.layout's built-in per-character monospace-
   like approximation. Sets `ctx`'s `.font` via text-font-string (the
   exact same helper render!'s own :text paint case uses) before each
   measurement, so a measured width always corresponds to the REAL font
   -- including real bold/italic metrics -- this host is really about
   to paint the text in.

   Closes a real, previously-documented gap: cssom.layout's OLDER
   `(fn [text font-size] ...)` callback contract had no font-weight/
   font-style parameter at all, so word-wrap measurement for bold/
   italic text always used NORMAL-weight, upright metrics even though
   the PAINT step already correctly rendered bold/italic -- a real, if
   minor and rarely visible, inconsistency (bold text is typically
   ~5-10% wider than normal at the same point size) between where a
   line wraps and how wide its real glyphs render, confirmed via direct
   REPL reproduction (a long bold string wrapped identically to the
   same string in normal weight) before this fix. cssom.layout's own
   callback contract was extended to pass font-weight/font-style
   through; this is the real host-side half of that same change. Now
   also takes a 5th `font-family` arg for the exact same reason -- an
   author's real font-family can genuinely have different, wider/
   narrower per-character metrics than the fixed system-font fallback
   word-wrap measurement always assumed before, another instance of the
   same measurement/paint disagreement class as font-weight/font-style
   above."
